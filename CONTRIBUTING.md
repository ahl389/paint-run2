## Getting Started & Workflow

Clone the repo

```

In your terminal, navigate to the project's root

```bash
cd paint-run2
```

Create a new branch for yourself

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

To see the app locally, from the project's root directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/


When you're ready to stage and commit your changes, do so with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m '<your commit message here>'
```

Push them to your branch:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```


Come back to the repo here, and create a pull request by hitting the `New Pull Request` button toward the top. Select your branch from the list.
