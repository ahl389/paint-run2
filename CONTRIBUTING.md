# Contributing

Any and all help is appreciated on this game. If you contribute, please update the `contributors.md` file. Look at the issues tab for any features or things you want to work on and comment. First timers, women, and new contributors especially welcome.

## Creating Issues

If you see something that needs a fix but don't have the time or interest to get to, please create a new issue! There are several issue tags available - add the ones you think are more relevant. If it's a small, easy fix, go ahead and add the "good first issue" tag to encourage new people to the project or new developers to participate!


## Getting Started & Workflow

1) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahl389/paint-run2.git
```

2) In your terminal, navigate to the project's root

```bash
cd paint-run2
```

3) Install the contents of `package.json` to make sure you have all the needed dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
````

4) Create a new branch for yourself

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

To see the app locally, from the project's root directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/


When you're ready to stage and commit your changes, do so with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m '<your commit message here>'
```

Push them to your branch:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```


Come back to the repo here, and create a pull request by hitting the `New Pull Request` button toward the top. Select your branch from the list.
