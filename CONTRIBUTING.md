# Contributing

Any and all help is appreciated on this game. If you contribute, please update the `contributors.md` file. Look at the issues tab for any features or things you want to work on and comment. First timers, women, and new contributors especially welcome.

## Creating Issues

If you see something that needs a fix, or you have an idea but don't have the time or interest to get to it, please create a new issue! There are several issue tags available - add the ones you think are most relevant. If it's a small, easy fix, be sure to add the "good first issue" tag to encourage folx that are to the project or are new developers to participate!


## Getting Started & Workflow

1) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahl389/paint-run2.git
```

2) In your terminal, navigate to the project's root

```bash
cd paint-run2
```

3) Install the contents of `package.json` to make sure you have all the needed dependencies by running

```bash
npm install
````

4) Create a new branch for yourself

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

5) To see the app locally, from the project's root directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/


6) When you're ready to stage and commit your changes, do so with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m '<your commit message here>'
```

7) Then, push them to your branch:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

8) Come back to the repo here, and create a pull request by hitting the `New Pull Request` button toward the top. Select your branch from the list.

9) Don't forget - regularly stage and commit your changes. Also, it's good practice to regularly pull down from master to make sure you have the most up to date version of the code. With several contributors, things can get confusing quickly! Do your best to write useful comments where appropriate so other people know what your code is doing!
