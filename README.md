# Paint Run

## Game Overview

Paint Run is a 2D game written in React. The objective of the game is to "paint" all the tiles on a level blue before opposing forces paint them gold, and before the timer runs out.

### Game Controls

Players move around the level using the arrow keys.

### Opposing Forces

Opposing forces are busy painting the level gold while the player paints it blue. If a player moves to the same tile as an opposing force three times, that opposing force will be neutralized and disappear.

## Getting Started & Workflow

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahl389/paint-run2.git
```

In your terminal, navigate to the project's root

```bash
cd paint-run2
```

Create a new branch for yourself

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

To see the app locally, from the project's root directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000/


When you're ready to stage and commit your changes, do so with:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m '<your commit message here>'
```

Push them to your branch:

```bash
git push origin <your-branch-name>

# Boilerplate React Stuff Below

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
